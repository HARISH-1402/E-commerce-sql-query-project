# E-commerce SQL Project

This project simulates a basic e-commerce system using a MySQL database. It includes structured data for users, products, orders, payments, and product reviews.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `ecommerce_schema.sql` – Contains `CREATE TABLE` statements for all six tables
- `ecommerce_data.sql` – Contains `INSERT INTO` statements with 60+ sample records
- `analysis_queries.sql` – Contains SQL queries for business data analysis

## 📊 Key Tables

- **Users** – Stores user details
- **Products** – Stores product information
- **Categories** – Groups products by category
- **Orders** – Stores order details linked to users and products
- **Payments** – Tracks payment status for orders
